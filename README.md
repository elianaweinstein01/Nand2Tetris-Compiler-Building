# Nand2Tetris-Compiler-Building
This repository contains my work for Nand2Tetris Projects 7–11, where I implemented a complete Jack-to-VM compiler from scratch. These projects are part of the legendary Nand2Tetris course  — where you build a computer system from first principles, all the way from logic gates to a working operating system and compiler.
